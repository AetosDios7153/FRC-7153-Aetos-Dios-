# FRC-7153-Arcade-Drive-Command

This is a project dated back to my participation as the lead programmer of my high school team in FIRST Robotics Competitions. 
The code is programmed in java and function as sets of commands that direct our robot to accomplish certain actions like moving to certain distance with PID and picking up the cube at a designated position (different action gains respective scores in the game).
I celebrate this as one of my first ever coding experience.
